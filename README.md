Some projects I did for my Discrete Mathematics class in Java

Guide:
  Tech 1: Uses hash sets to make a Cartesian product or the power set of an input set.
  Tech 2: Takes input integers of 'n' elements and 'r' choices from those elements, does permutation or combination (both with repetition allowed).
  Tech 3: takes input integers of 'n' elements and 'r' choices from those elements, does the combination of the two
  Tech 4: Takes the alphabet and either does every unique permutation or combination of 4 letters. Note, there's a lot of combinations, and even more permutations, be careful when printing it all out
  Tech 5: Takes two input booleans and does the and, or, xor, conditional, and bi-conditional of both. 
  Tech 6: Takes an array of unsorted numbers, and searches for a given number using linear, binary, and ternary sort.
  Tech 7: Produces change for a specified dollar amount using the greedy algorithm
  Tech 8: Uses recursion to find the value of the given number in the Fibonacci sequence
